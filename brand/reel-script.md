# Hytrain UGC Reel Script

## Overview
- **Style:** UGC (user-generated content) — casual, authentic
- **Location:** Local gym with limited HYROX equipment
- **Length:** ~40 seconds
- **Platform:** Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts

---

## Hook
**"I saved $4000 training for HYROX like this"**

This hook works because:
- Specific number grabs attention
- Money saving = instant interest
- "like this" creates curiosity

---

## Your Gym Situation

**Missing equipment:**
- SkiErg
- Sled push/pull
- Heavy kettlebells
- Sandbag

**Alternatives you'll show:**

| Missing | Alternative |
|---------|-------------|
| SkiErg | Medicine ball slams |
| Sled push | Resistance band pushes |
| Sandbag lunges | Dumbbell lunges |

---

## Shot-by-Shot Script

| Shot | Time | Visual | You Say |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **1** | 0-3s | Close-up on face, confident/direct look at camera | "I saved $4000 training for HYROX like this" |
| **2** | 3-6s | Pan across gym, show limited equipment | "My gym has no SkiErg. No sled. No sandbags." |
| **3** | 6-9s | Back to you, holding phone | "But this app builds workouts with what you actually have" |
| **4** | 9-13s | Screen: selecting equipment (dumbbells ✓, etc.) | *no talking, just show tapping* |
| **5** | 13-18s | Screen: generated workout showing alternatives | "SkiErg? Medicine ball slams. Sled? Band pushes. Sandbag? Dumbbells." |
| **6** | 18-28s | Quick cuts: running → slams → band pushes → lunges (2-3 sec each) | *no talking, just workout footage* |
| **7** | 28-32s | Back to you, slightly out of breath | "Same workout. No $4000 equipment." |
| **8** | 32-36s | Point up (for link in bio) or show phone | "It's free. hytrain.pro — link in bio" |

## Key Lines

**Opening hook:**
> "I saved $4000 training for HYROX like this"

**Closing callback:**
> "Same workout. No $4000 equipment."

This creates a loop — hook and payoff connect.

---

## Shot 5 — Alternative Lines

Pick whichever feels most natural:

**Option A — Rapid fire:**
> "SkiErg? Medicine ball slams. Sled? Band pushes. Sandbag? Dumbbells."

**Option B — List it out:**
> "So instead of SkiErg — medicine ball slams. Sled push — resistance band pushes. Sandbag lunges — dumbbell lunges"

**Option C — Conversational:**
> "It swaps everything — slams for SkiErg, band pushes for sled, dumbbell lunges for sandbag"

## Exercises to Film

| Exercise | Filming Tip |
|----------|-------------|
| **Running** | Treadmill from side, or outside sprint toward/away from camera |
| **Medicine ball slams** | Side angle, catch the slam impact |
| **Resistance band pushes** | Anchor band to rack/pole, film from behind or side showing the push motion |
| **Dumbbell lunges** | Walking toward camera or side angle |

---

## Running Shot Options

| Type | Vibe | Filming Tip |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Treadmill** | Gym-consistent | Film from side, slight incline looks harder |
| **Outside gym** | Fresh air, dynamic | Quick sprint in parking lot or nearby path |
| **Running toward camera** | Powerful | Works great in montage |
| **Running away** | Journey feel | Good for montage section |

When screen recording the app, select these:

```
✓ Dumbbells
✓ Rowing machine (if available)
✓ Pull-up bar
✓ Medicine ball
✓ Resistance bands
✗ Everything else unchecked
```

## Pre-Film Checklist

**Before going to gym:**
- [ ] Screen record the app flow at home (better lighting)
- [ ] Know what equipment the gym has
- [ ] Wear workout clothes
- [ ] Charge phone

**At the gym:**
- [ ] Find spot with decent lighting
- [ ] Film the hook first (Shot 1) — confident energy
- [ ] Film workout shots while you have energy (slams, band pushes, lunges, running)
- [ ] Film talking parts last (slightly sweaty = authentic)
- [ ] Get the gym pan shot

---

## Filming Order (most efficient)

1. Screen record app flow at home first
2. Film hook (Shot 1) — do multiple takes, pick the best
3. Film running shot
4. Film workout shots: slams → band pushes → lunges
5. Film closing line (Shot 7)
6. Get the gym pan shot anytime

---

## Editing Tips

1. **Cut tight** — remove all pauses/ums
2. **Add captions** — most people watch on mute (especially the $4000 hook)
3. **Speed up screen recording** — 1.5x or 2x
4. **Quick cuts in montage** — 2 seconds max per exercise
5. **Trending sound** — low volume under your voice (optional)
6. **End card** — "hytrain.pro" text on screen for last 2-3 seconds
7. **Bold text on hook** — Make "$4000" pop visually

## Caption for Post

```
I saved $4000 training for HYROX.

My gym has no SkiErg. No sled. No sandbags.

This app builds workouts with what you actually have:
→ Medicine ball slams instead of SkiErg ($800)
→ Resistance band pushes instead of sled ($1500)
→ Dumbbell lunges instead of sandbag ($200)
→ Plus all the running 🏃

And it's free??

## Notes

- Total runtime: ~36-40 seconds
- Hook grabs attention with specific money claim
- Closing line callbacks to hook (creates loop)
- Montage shows 4 exercises: running + 3 station alternatives
- Keep energy confident — you found a hack, share it
- Don't over-polish — UGC style performs better than ads
- Post to Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts (same video works)
